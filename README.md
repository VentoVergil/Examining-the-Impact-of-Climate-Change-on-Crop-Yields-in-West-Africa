# Examining-the-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Crop-Yields-in-West-Africa

# Abstract
Climate change, with its associated extreme weather events and rising temperatures, poses a global challenge. West Africa, heavily reliant on agriculture, is particularly vulnerable to these impacts. Leveraging datasets from Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the Climate Change Knowledge Portal, this study 
examined the influence of temperature and precipitation on rice, maize, and wheat yields (1961-2022) using ARIMA and machine learning models.
